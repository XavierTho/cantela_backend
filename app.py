# ------------------------------
# FUTURE PLANS FOR QUIZ BACKEND HANDLING
# ------------------------------

# 1. User Authentication and Session Management
# ----------------------------------------------
# - Integrate user authentication to track quiz attempts and scores per user.
# - Use JWT tokens for secure session management.
# - Example of endpoint for user login (to be implemented):
# 
# @app.route('/api/auth/login', methods=['POST'])
# def user_login():
#     """
#     Handles user login.
#     Validates credentials and returns a JWT token for session management.
#     """
#     pass  # Placeholder for implementation

# 2. Dynamic Question Loading
# ---------------------------
# - Implement database integration to store and retrieve questions dynamically.
# - Enable categorization of questions based on topics or difficulty levels.
# - Example database schema (simplified):
# 
# CREATE TABLE questions (
#     id INT PRIMARY KEY,
#     text TEXT NOT NULL,
#     options JSON NOT NULL,
#     correct_answer TEXT NOT NULL,
#     category TEXT,
#     difficulty_level INT
# );

# 3. Personalized Quizzes
# -----------------------
# - Allow users to customize quizzes by selecting topics and difficulty levels.
# - Example endpoint for custom quiz generation:
# 
# @app.route('/api/quiz/custom', methods=['POST'])
# def create_custom_quiz():
#     """
#     Generates a custom quiz based on user preferences.
#     Accepts JSON with 'category' and 'difficulty' fields.
#     """
#     pass  # Placeholder for implementation

# 4. Quiz Statistics and Leaderboards
# -----------------------------------
# - Track user performance and generate quiz statistics (e.g., average scores, completion times).
# - Create leaderboards to display top performers.
# - Example endpoint for retrieving leaderboard data:
# 
# @app.route('/api/quiz/leaderboard', methods=['GET'])
# def get_leaderboard():
#     """
#     Retrieves the leaderboard data.
#     Returns the top users based on their quiz scores.
#     """
#     pass  # Placeholder for implementation

# 5. Timed Quizzes
# ----------------
# - Introduce a timer feature for quizzes to add time-bound challenges.
# - Store and compare completion times for additional scoring metrics.
# - Example of handling timer on the frontend (to be implemented with WebSockets for real-time updates):
# 
# function startQuizTimer(duration) {
#     // Starts a countdown timer for the given duration.
#     // Sends a real-time update to the backend when the timer expires.
# }

# 6. Advanced Feedback Mechanisms
# -------------------------------
# - Provide detailed feedback after quiz completion, including explanations for correct/incorrect answers.
# - Example of feedback generation (to be refined and implemented):
# 
# def generate_feedback(user_answers):
#     """
#     Generates feedback for each question based on user answers.
#     Returns a list of feedback objects containing question text, user answer, correct answer, and explanation.
#     """
#     pass  # Placeholder for implementation

# 7. Multilingual Support
# -----------------------
# - Expand the quiz backend to support multiple languages.
# - Store translations for each question and allow users to select their preferred language.
# - Example endpoint for setting language preference:
# 
# @app.route('/api/user/language', methods=['POST'])
# def set_language_preference():
#     """
#     Sets the user's language preference for quizzes.
#     Accepts a JSON payload with the selected language.
#     """
#     pass  # Placeholder for implementation

# ------------------------------
# END OF FUTURE PLANS
